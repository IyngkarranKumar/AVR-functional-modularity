Outline of the code files:
- Code for the binary weight masking algorithm is in the **masking.py** file.
- Code that ran the mask analysis is in **mask_analysis.py**
- Code that executed the masking on the SCL model is in **SCL_masking.ipynb**. The hyperparameter search for $\alpha$ is under $\alpha$ sweep
- Code that trained SCL *before* masking was ran is in **SCL_pretrain.iypnb**
- Code to generate task datasets is in the **datasets/gen.sh** file
